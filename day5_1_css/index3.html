        Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost
        exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, is found north of the Equator.
        Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for
        swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills
        and swallow it whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.

        They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.

        The largest living species is the Emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3
        ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula
        minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 33 cm (13 in) tall and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb).Today,
        larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or
        tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was
        a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km
        south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.
